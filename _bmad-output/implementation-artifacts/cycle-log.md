### 2026-04-12T17:00:00Z — Hotfix: Router Dispatch Fix
- **Issue:** Manual HTTP testing revealed all routes returned 404. Two root causes:
  1. `Page()` override replaced `%CSP.REST` dispatch mechanism entirely
  2. UrlMap `Call="ClassName:Method"` cross-class syntax doesn't work
- **Fix:** Local wrapper methods for Call dispatch, `ReportHttpStatusCode` override for custom 404/error JSON
